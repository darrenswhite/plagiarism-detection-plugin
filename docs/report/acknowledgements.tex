I am grateful to my supervisor Chris Loftus, for the continued support, inspiration, and guidance throughout this project. The organised weekly meetings provided assurance, and proved useful to discuss any problems encountered.

I'd like to thank my loving family and close friends, for their support and encouragement each step of the way.
