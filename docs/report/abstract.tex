\end{center}

Source code plagiarism is an ever-growing issue in academia, primarily in Computer Science. The majority of tools that exist to detect plagiarism only analyse the final piece of code. This paper discusses the research and development of a new tool which detects how the code was written. This tool will be an IntelliJ IDEA plugin and tracks file changes in the editor. The tracked data gives more of an insight into how plagiarism evolves over the course of development. This method of detection allows direct identification of the specific pieces of code that were plagiarised.
