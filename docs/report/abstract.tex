\end{center}

Source code plagiarism is an ever-growing issue in academia, primarily in Computer Science. The majority of tools that exist to detect plagiarism only analyse the final piece of code. This paper shows the research and development of a new tool which will detect how the code was written. This tool will be an IntelliJ IDEA plugin and will track file changes in the editor. The tracked data will give more of an insight into how plagiarism evolves over the course of development. This method of detection would allow direct identification of the specific pieces of code that were plagiarised.
